You don't even have to type your controllers if you don't want to. You can start your controllers and services in the appropriate place for that.\nThe Binding class is a class that will decouple dependency injection, while \"binding\" routes to the state manager and dependency manager.\nThis allows Get to know which screen is being displayed when a particular controller is used and to know where and how to dispose of it.\nIn addition, the Binding class will allow you to have SmartManager configuration control.
