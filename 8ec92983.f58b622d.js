If you send events for 1 minute, 1000 per second, debounce will only send you the last one, when the user stops strafing events. interval will deliver events every second, and if set to 3 seconds, it will deliver 20 events that minute. This is recommended to avoid abuse, in functions where the user can quickly click on something and get some advantage (imagine that the user can earn coins by clicking on something, if he clicked 300 times in the same minute, he would have 300 coins, using interval, you you can set a time frame for 3 seconds, and even then clicking 300 or a thousand times, the maximum he would get in 1 minute would be 20 coins, clicking 300 or 1 million times). The debounce is suitable for anti-DDos, for functions like search where each change to onChange would cause a query to your api. Debounce will wait for the user to stop typing the name, to make the request.
