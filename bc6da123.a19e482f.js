Thinking about it and aiming to maximize the consumption of resources that Obx was created. Unlike GetX and GetBuilder, you will not be able to initialize a controller inside an Obx, it is just a Widget with a StreamSubscription that receives change events from your children, that's all. It is more economical than GetX, but loses to GetBuilder, which was to be expected, since it is reactive, and GetBuilder has the most simplistic approach that exists, of storing a widget's hashcode and its StateSetter. With Obx you don't need to write your controller type, and you can hear the change from multiple different controllers, but it needs to be initialized before, either using the example approach at the beginning of this readme, or using the Bindings class."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},86:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",(function(){return d})),n.d(t,"b",(function(){return h}));var a=n(0),i=n.n(a);function r(e,t,n){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:n,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=n,e}function o(e,t){var n=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(a=a.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),n.push.apply(n,a)}return n}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var n=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?o(Object(n),!0).forEach((function(t){r(e,t,n[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(n)):o(Object(n)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(n,t))}))}return e}function l(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,i=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,i={},r=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<r.length;a++)n=r[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(i[n]=e[n]);return i}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<r.length;a++)n=r[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(i[n]=e[n])}return i}var c=i.a.createContext({}),u=function(e){var t=i.a.useContext(c),n=t;return e&&(n="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),n},d=function(e){var t=u(e.components);return i.a.createElement(c.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},m={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,{},t)}},p=i.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var n=e.components,a=e.mdxType,r=e.originalType,o=e.parentName,c=l(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),d=u(n),p=a,h=d["".concat(o,".").concat(p)]||d[p]||m[p]||r;return n?i.a.createElement(h,s(s({ref:t},c),{},{components:n})):i.a.createElement(h,s({ref:t},c))}));function h(e,t){var n=arguments,a=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||a){var r=n.length,o=new Array(r);o[0]=p;var s={};for(var l in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,l)&&(s[l]=t[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:a,o[1]=s;for(var c=2;c<r;c++)o[c]=n[c];return i.a.createElement.apply(null,o)}return i.a.createElement.apply(null,n)}p.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
